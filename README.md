Springer has opened up some of their catalogue to be dowloaded for free. This repository contains code that scrapes the data and put it on a table for easy reference and consumption.

```shell
npm install && npm run scrape
```

Wait for the script to run to completion and Profit!

A JSON and CSV file with the data will be available at the `./export` folder.
